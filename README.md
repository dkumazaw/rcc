# yarcc: A C compiler written in Rust [WIP]
This ongoing project aims to fully support all of C89/90 features. Please take a look at `examples` and test cases for currently supported features.

## Usage:
You can either provide the code as the first argument or pass the path to the file you want to compile:

```cargo run examples/test.c```
